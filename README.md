Mongoose soft delete. I created it because other packages that I tested didn't work properly.

## How it works

`Model.remove()` was extended to set `deleted: true` without real removing.
To methods `find`, `findOne`, `update`, `findOneAndUpdate`, `findOneAndRemove`
were added middleware to show only data without `deleted: true`.

## Configuration

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const softDelete = require('mongoose-soft');

const db = mongoose.createConnection('mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db');
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({ text: String });

schema.plugin(softDelete);
db.model('posts', schema);
```

## Find deleted data

If you want to see deleted data pass `deleted: true` in the query object.
If you want to see all data pass `deleted: { $in: [null, true, false] }`.
